        <p>Go is an open source programming language supported by Google.</p>
        <p>The language makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.</p>
        <p>We are gophers (Go developers) from the paradise island of Mauritius. A tiny island in the Indian Ocean with loads of sunshine and equally bright minds.</p>
        <p>Our fellowship is a new one, initiated with developers who fell in love with Go and have used it professionally. We look forward to sharing our experience with more people; hoping we can make friends to learn and laugh along the way.</p>
