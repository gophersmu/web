**Note**

Thank you very much for your interest. 

However due to unfortunate circumstances, it would be ill-advised to maintain gatherings, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore the event has been cancelled; to be rescheduled in the future, when times are better.

Our friends are also advised to take all necessary precautions to stay safe during these trying times.
